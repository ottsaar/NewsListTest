# NewsListTest

If you just wish to test the application you can do it via this [link](http://178.157.91.173:3000/). 

I try to keep the server running, but if the server is down, please contact me via email(SL team should have my email :)).


This is a basic react application:
* clone the repo
* npm install - run it inside the folder to install the dependecies
* npm start - to start the server, I haven't setup any production build.
* done :)

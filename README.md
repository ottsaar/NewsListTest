# NewsListTest

If just wish to test the repo you can do it via this [link](http://178.157.91.173:3000/).

This is a basic react application:
* clone the repo
* npm install - run it inside the folder to install the dependecies
* npm start - to start the server, I haven't setup production code.
* done :)
